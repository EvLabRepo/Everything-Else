INSTRUCTIONS:

First, if you can, update endnote_database.txt with current complete evlab endnote database.

Copy/paste a manuscript of a paper with in-text citations into doc.rtf, then run python copy_refs_from_endnote.py in terminal. 

This script will identify all citations in the text and copy those currently in the evlab endnote database into refs.txt. 

Terminal will print a list of ‘FOUND’ and ‘NOT FOUND’ references.
